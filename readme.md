# CellLab

## How to run

While this project includes dev-dependencies, those are purly for development convinence. The src folder can just be hosted anywhere and run just fine without any build steps.

## Recommended dev setup

- Any editor with biome support (Like vscodium with the biome extension)
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`

A port will be opened with a dev server.
